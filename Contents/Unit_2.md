## 2.1 Major Past Earthquakes  

Earthquakes of different magnitudes and intensities across the world have demonstrated the vulnerability of poorly designed structures. Studying past events provides crucial insight into **failure modes** and **earthquake engineering practices**.  

### üåç Significant Global Earthquakes  

| Year | Location | Magnitude (Mw) | Key Effects |

üìå **Key Observations**  
- **Unreinforced masonry (URM)** and **non-engineered buildings** fail catastrophically.  
- **Reinforced concrete (RC) buildings** suffer brittle failure if **ductile detailing** is absent.  
- Earthquakes affect not only the epicentral region but also far-off cities due to **soil amplification**.

# **2.2 Lessons Learnt**

Earthquakes have repeatedly shown that while they are natural phenomena, the **extent of damage and loss of life** depends largely on how societies prepare and build their infrastructure. Key lessons from past earthquakes emphasize the **importance of engineering practices, codes, and public preparedness**.


## **(a) Importance of Building Codes**

* Building codes (e.g., **IS 1893: Criteria for Earthquake Resistant Design of Structures**) provide minimum safety standards.
* Regions that **enforce codes strictly** suffer significantly less damage compared to regions with poor implementation.
* Example:

  * **Bhuj Earthquake, 2001** ‚Äì Many buildings collapsed due to **non-engineered construction** without seismic provisions.
  * **Japan, 2011 T≈çhoku Earthquake** ‚Äì Strict code enforcement helped high-rise structures withstand strong shaking, even near epicenter.

**Lesson:** Codes must not only exist but also be **regularly updated** and **strictly enforced**.

## **(b) Ductile Detailing**

* **Ductility** = ability of structures to undergo large deformations **without sudden failure**.
* Special detailing of **reinforced concrete (RC) structures** ensures that even under strong shaking, **structures fail in a controlled, life-saving manner**.
* Example:

  * In the **Nepal Earthquake, 2015**, buildings with **ductile detailing (IS 13920 provisions in India)** performed far better compared to brittle masonry structures.

**Lesson:** Adoption of **ductile detailing provisions** in RC frames can drastically reduce collapse risk.

## **(c) Soil Conditions**

* Earthquake damage is strongly influenced by **local soil and geology**.
* **Soft soils** can amplify shaking, while **liquefaction** in loose, saturated soils causes ground failure.
* Example:

  * **Bhuj, 2001** ‚Äì Severe liquefaction in Kutch region caused tilting/collapse of buildings.
  * **Mexico City, 1985** ‚Äì Amplification on soft lakebed soils worsened shaking compared to surrounding areas.

**Lesson:** Proper **geotechnical investigation** is as critical as structural design.

## **(d) Public Awareness and Preparedness**

* Even well-designed structures cannot save lives if **occupants are unprepared**.
* **Earthquake drills, awareness programs, and community preparedness** reduce casualties.
* Example:

  * **Japan** conducts annual nationwide earthquake drills (Disaster Prevention Day, Sept 1), resulting in disciplined and quick evacuation.
  * In contrast, **Nepal 2015** saw higher casualties due to lack of awareness and poor emergency planning.

**Lesson:** Public awareness is a **non-engineering measure** that is equally vital in disaster risk reduction.

# **2.3 Types of Damages to Buildings**

Earthquakes affect buildings in diverse ways depending on **structural design, materials, soil conditions, and intensity of shaking**. Recognizing the common types of damages helps engineers design safer buildings and prepare effective mitigation strategies.

## **2.3.1 Classification of Damages**

Damages can broadly be classified into:

1. **Structural Damage**

   * Affects the main load-bearing system (beams, columns, shear walls, slabs).
   * May lead to partial or total collapse.
   * Critical for life safety.
   * *Examples*: Column shear failure in Bhuj (2001), soft-storey collapse in Nepal (2015).


*Fig. Structural damage in RCC frame*

2. **Non-Structural Damage**

   * Affects non-load-bearing elements (walls, partitions, ceilings, fa√ßades, utilities).
   * Though less critical for collapse, these damages can cause injuries, economic loss, and disrupt functionality.
   * *Examples*: Cracking of plaster, collapse of parapet walls, falling false ceilings.

*Fig. Non-structural wall damage*

## **2.3.2 Types of Structural Damages**

1. **Foundation Failure**

   * Caused by **liquefaction, settlement, or soil amplification**.
   * Buildings tilt or sink.
   * *Example*: Tilting of multi-storey buildings in Mexico City (1985).
   * **Key factor**: Poor soil investigation before construction.

2. **Column Failures**

   * Columns are primary vertical load carriers; their failure often leads to **progressive collapse**.
   * Modes of failure:

     * Short column effect
     * Shear cracking
     * Buckling under axial loads
   * *Example*: Bhuj (2001) ‚Äì brittle column shear failures in poorly detailed RC buildings.

*Fig. Seismic Shear Failure in Reinforced Concrete Columns*

4. **Beam Failures**

   * Flexural cracks at mid-span or shear cracks near supports.
   * Poor reinforcement anchorage leads to brittle fracture.
   * Less catastrophic than column failure but compromises lateral resistance.

<img width="549" height="411" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54be4cb9-4fad-43d7-ba55-90927653b864" />

*Fig. Beam shear failure during an earthquake*

5. **Soft Storey Mechanism**

   * Occurs when **one storey (often ground floor) is much weaker or more flexible** than the others (e.g., parking or open commercial spaces).
   * Concentrated damage leads to "pancake" collapse.
   * *Example*: Many apartment buildings in Bhuj and Nepal earthquakes.

<img width="638" height="331" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6d0c3de-e33f-4d0e-8022-b25c05c25fc8" />

*Fig. Building collapse due to first story failure during the Simav earthquake.*


6. **Masonry Wall Failures**

   * Out-of-plane collapse due to lack of lateral ties.
   * Diagonal shear cracking in in-plane walls.
   * Parapet and gable wall collapses cause casualties.
   * *Example*: Unreinforced masonry (URM) structures in Kashmir 2005 quake.

*Fig. Failure of Walls between Opening*

7. **Roof and Slab Failures**

   * Diaphragm action is lost if roof slabs are not properly anchored.
   * Heavy roofs increase inertia forces.
   * Timber roofs perform better due to flexibility and light weight.

*Fig. Typical Failure Modes of Stone Masonry Building in Weak Mortar*

## **2.3.3 Types of Non-Structural Damages**

* **Partition wall cracks**
* **Falling ceilings, glass panels, tiles**
* **Failure of chimneys, water tanks, parapets**
* **Damage to lifelines** ‚Äì electric supply, gas pipelines, water supply.

Such damages, while not always life-threatening, **disrupt rescue operations** and increase **post-disaster recovery costs**.

## **2.3.4 Factors Influencing Damage Severity**

1. **Seismic intensity and duration of shaking**
2. **Soil type and liquefaction susceptibility**
3. **Quality of design and detailing (ductility provisions, IS 13920)**
4. **Construction practices (use of poor materials, lack of supervision)**
5. **Building typology (URM, RCC, steel, timber)**

## **2.3.5 Summary Table: Structural vs. Non-Structural Damages**

| **Category**          | **Examples**                            | **Impact**                          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Structural Damage     | Column shear, beam flexure, soft storey | Collapse risk, life-threatening     |
| Non-Structural Damage | Cracked plaster, falling parapets       | Injuries, economic loss, disruption |
